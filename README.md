# Airfoil
Computes velocity and pressure coefficient around an airfoil.
Code was translated from (Kuethe & Chow, 1986) p. 134 [*](.airfoil.f).

# Example use:
The main section of airfoil.py reproduces fig.26 of caphter 5 section 11: The Airfoil of Arbitrary Thickness and Camber from (Kuethe & Chow, 1986) p. 134.
```python airfoil.py```

NACA.py can be used to create .txt files formatted as needed for curve generation by ANSYS's design modeller.
```
from NACA import fourDigitSeries, ansysPtFormat
# Get's XY scatter defining airfoil
XB, YB = fourDigitSeries(2412, NUMBER_OF_PANELS)
# Output coordinates textfile for use by DesignModeler 3D curve tool.
ansysPtFormat("./NACA2412.txt", XB, YB)
```

## Description
Involves the representation of the airfoil with a closed polygon of vortex panels.
Circulation density on each panel varies linearly from one corner to the other and is continuous across the corner.
The kutta condition is easily incorporated and the computation stable unless a large number of panels is chosen or an airfoil with a cusped trailling edge.

## To dos
Ensure that profiles start at 0,0 and end at 1,0; I beleive this is needed to calculate lift as described in Moran (2003).

## Notes on compiling FORTRAN
The compiler was taken from http://www.mingw.org/.
